You can combine gate (and trigger) signals of varying length in an OR circuit, and where they partially overlap, you will get new gate lengths.

The output patched to an ADSR can add variation and expression to a sequence. (The efficacy of mere triggers will depend on how much of an envelope you’ll get from your particular ADSR or ASR.)

Example:

- patch one square wave LFO to an input on an OR circuit
- patch a different, unsync’d square wave LFO to the other input
- patch the output of the OR circuit to the gate input on an ADSR (or ASR)
