If you combine two rhythmic patterns in an AND circuit, you can derive a third accent rhythm from where the two rhythms overlap. This technique works particularly well with inputs such as Euclidean sequences and clocks that have a 50% duty cycles, and less well with just triggers as inputs (because the high signals of each input must overlap from time to time in order to derive a new rhythm).

Example:

- patch one Euclidean gate sequence to an input of an AND circuit (or VCA)
- patch another Euclidean gate sequence to the other input
- patch the output of the AND circuit to trigger a percussion module or envelope
