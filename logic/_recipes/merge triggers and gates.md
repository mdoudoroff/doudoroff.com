You can combine two or more trigger and/or gate signals using OR logic. The result is similar to using a mixer, except that a mixer adds the signals together, resulting in potentially high amplitude, whereas the output of OR logic will always be either 0V or whatever itâ€™s high voltage is (typically 5V, but designs may vary).

Note: with OR logic, gates that overlap are essentially merged (run together) to form a longer gate.

Example:

- patch two different trigger or gate rhythms to the inputs on an OR logic circuit
- patch OR output to trigger a percussion module or envelope
