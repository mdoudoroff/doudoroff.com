A simple flipflop will hold its state (high or low) until it receives a rising edge (trigger or gate) at its input, at which point it will switch to the other state.

Toggling is literally what your basic flipflops do.

Example:

- patch the output of a flipflop to a VCA CV input
- patch something (anything) to the VCA’s input
- send a trigger to the flipflop’s input
- send another trigger to the flipflop’s input

Result: the VCA will be held open or closed by the flipflop, reversing each time a trigger is received by the flipflop.
