While you can use OR logic to merge two trigger and/or gate streams, when the gates overlap, they merge together, so the fact that two events are happening concurrently is lost. Special logic circuits have been created, such as the “gater” feature on Klavis’ Logica Gater, Logica XT and Two Bits, that act like an OR circuit informed by an XOR circuit. This specialty circuit will retrigger (drop low and then go high again) when a trigger or gate from one input interrupts a gate on the other input.

Example:

- patch two different trigger or gate rhythms to the inputs on a “gater”-style logic circuit
- patch OR output to trigger a percussion module or envelope
