Logic circuits interpret any input signals as “on” or “off”, kind of like a crude comparator. Logic modules may vary in exactly how they respond based on design choices. You can send audio through a logic circuit (such as OR or XOR) and get a heavily distorted-sounding square wave signal out. You can send a fluctuating CV signal through the same logic circuit and get a (slower) square wave pattern out that is the circuit’s reduction of the input signal.

Note: best results will typically depend on a strongly bipolar input signal.
