A comparator outputs a binary (high or low) signal, indistinguishable from a pulse or gate stream. If you feed the comparator with a regular triangle, saw or ramp wave, you will get a regular pulse wave out of the comparator, and the width of the pulses will depend on the voltage the comparator is comparing the signal to.

Example:

- patch a saw or ramp wave from an oscillator to the input on a comparator
- patch the output of the comparator to where you can hear it
- adjust the value of the comparator with the offset knob and listen to the pulse width modulate
- instead of manually adjusting the offset knob, patch a triangle LFO to the second input on the comparator for automated PWM

Note: you can also use a mixer to combine your saw or ramp wave with an LFO signal, patch the result to the input of the comparator, and leave the comparatorâ€™s offset at zero to a somewhat similar effect. 

If you have access to a window comparator (e.g., Joranalogue Compare 2) and pass it a <strong>triangle</strong> wave as your input, by adjusting or modulating the parameters on the window comparator, you can create PWM with pairs of pulses that separate and combine, resulting in both PWM-style timbres and octave shifts.
