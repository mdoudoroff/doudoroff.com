You can combine two different wave shapes—audio or CV—using analog OR logic. 

Note: You’ll only get the positive (above 0V) portion of the results.

Example:

- patch a sawtooth wave from an oscillator to an analog OR circuit input
- patch an attenuated square wave from the same oscillator to the other input

Result: a new waveform that follows the positive MAX value of the superimposed signals
