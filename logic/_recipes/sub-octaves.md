If you patch a square wave (at either audio or sub-audio frequency) into a flipflop, you get divide by two from the output (an octave lower in pitch). If you patch that output through a second flipflop, you get divide by 4 (two octaves lower in pitch). You can use the same principle to derive /2 and /4 clock divisions.

Note that some logic modules offer flipflops with other labels, such as “/2” or “SET/RESET”.

Example:

- patch a square wave from an oscillator to the input on a flipflop
- patch the output to mix into one of the other waveforms from your oscillator for a richer, thicker sound
