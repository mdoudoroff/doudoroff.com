If you mult the trigger or gate driving an envelope or triggering percussion to the input on a gate delay, you can derive a second, identical trigger or gate that you can patch to create an additional note or hit that happens later. This technique can be musically interesting with short delays, long delays, and delays that are constantly changing under CV control.

Example:

- start with a conventional voice playing a sequence
- mult the sequence gate output to the input on a gate delay
- patch the output of the gate delay to a second envelope, and complete the patch however you need to so that the second envelope will result in its own note event
- adjust the gate delay to taste
- if your gate delay offers CV control, try using an attenuated LFO to modulate the delay time
