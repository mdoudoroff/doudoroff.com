You can mult the triggers and gates for one voice into a NOR or NOT circuit, and the circuit will be high only in the spaces between those triggers and gates. By patching this output to an AND circuit (or a VCA) with the triggers and gates for a second voice, you can limit the latter to the spaces inbetween.

Example:

- patch a copy of the triggers for a kick drum to a NOR or NOT circuit
- patch the triggers intended for a high hat to an AND circuit
- patch the output of the NOR or NOT circuit to the AND circuit
- patch the output of the AND circuit to the high hat voice

Result: the high hat should not trigger when the kick triggers
