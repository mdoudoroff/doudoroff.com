You can use AND logic like a simple VCA to filter (pass or mute) any trigger or gate stream. One application is create a drum fill trigger pattern and use AND logic so that it only plays occasionally as a fill, rather than playing constantly.

Example:

- patch a trigger pattern to one input on an AND logic circuit
- patch a gate (e.g., from a sequencer or button) to the other input
- patch the output to a percussion module (or to a trigger combiner that is patched to a percussion module)
