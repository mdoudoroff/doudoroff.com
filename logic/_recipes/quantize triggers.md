If you combine any regular stream of triggers or short gates (such as a clock with a short duty cycle) with an irregular gate stream (such as gates from a keyboard), the resulting triggers/pulses will be constrained (quantized) to the regular rhythm.

Example:

- patch a static rhythm of triggers (or short pulses) to an input of an AND circuit (or VCA)
- patch the gates from a keyboard to the other input
- patch the output of the AND circuit to trigger a percussion module

Result: no matter when you press keys on the keyboard, the triggered sound will only fall on the regular rhythm
