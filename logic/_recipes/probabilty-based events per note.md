You can patch a copy of the gate from your sequence or keyboard through a gate skipper, and patch the output of the skipper to another envelope (or VCA) for whatever means to alter the sound of the note. You can then adjust the gate skipper to taste so that the modulation occurs with any frequency from never and always.

Example:

- create a “standard” keyboard- (or sequencer-based) voice with pitch —> VCO —> filter —> VCA voice, including an ADSR (or ASR) to shape the note through the filter and/or VCA
- mult the keyboard/sequencer gate to gate skipper and set the probability around halfway (50%)
- patch the output of the gate skipper to a second envelope
- patch the output of the second envelope to a timbre parameter on the VCO

Result: when you play notes, half the time, the timbre of the voice will be modulated by the second envelope. Adjust the skip probability to taste.
