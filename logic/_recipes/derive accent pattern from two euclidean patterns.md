If you combine two rhythmic patterns in an AND circuit, you can derive a third accent rhythm from where the two rhythms overlap. This technique works particularly well with Euclidean sequences.

Example:

- patch one Euclidean gate sequence to an input of an AND circuit (or VCA)
- patch another Euclidean gate sequence to the other input
- patch the output of the AND circuit to trigger a percussion module
