If you combine clocks and/or logic outputs derived from those clocks in a CV mixer, and then quantize the result to a scale, you have created a melodic pitch sequence without a sequencer. Swapping around the sources of the mixes, adjusting levels will result in different melodies. 

Example:

- patch two or more different clock sources into a logic module
- patch patch different logic outputs—ones that are changing due to the clocks—to a mixer
- patch the mixer’s output to a quantizer
- use the quantizer’s output to pitch a voice
- try different logic outputs, different combinations of clock divisions, and different mixer attenuations
