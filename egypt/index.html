      <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56638514-ancient-egypt">Ancient Egypt: The Definitive Visual History</a> (2021) — large “coffee table”-style book, but organized into easily digestible bits, basically chronological, extensive visual references, handy reference to ancient Egyptian dieties</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Ancient Egyptian History from 30,000 feet</h2>
    <p>(This is Martin’s attempt to reduce 3,000 years of history to a most basic framework for the sake of memory.) By coincidence, the four major dynastic eras of ancient egypt almost fit into neat 500 year chunks, with 100 years (give or take) of instability and strife at the end of each.</p>
