<h1>The History of Genever</h1>

<p>Almost as soon as distilling knowledge travelled from the Middle East to Europe as a result of the Muslim invasions of Spain (711 AD) and southern Italy (827 AD), juniper berries began to be preserved in distilled alcohol, which meant the juniper kept its medicinal qualities. Juniper berries, native to Europe, were a wonder medicine, aiding digestion, constipation, and all kinds of gastrointestinal upset, among many other uses. The distilled alcohol used to preserve it was based on local grapes in Spain and Italy, but as distilling knowledge expanded to colder countries like Ireland and Holland, local grains were used to distill instead. 
</p>
<p>The first printed mention of distilling in Dutch was in 1269 and included a reference to juniper, where it was referred to as a medicine. By 1497, “korenbrandewijn” (meaning “grain wine”, and referring to grain distillate with juniper), was so widely recreationally drunk in Holland that it began to be taxed. Initially genever was mostly grape-based, but by  1588 genever in Holland was grain-based more often than not. The quality of the grain distillate was the main attraction, and juniper - plus any other botanical - was very much the supporting actor, imbuing only faint hints of additional flavour. Genever used distilling craft and botanicals for flavour, not barrels, and if it was to be stored or transported, barrels were picked for their neutrality. Incidentally, whisky was at exactly the same stage of its development, at the same time. One of the oldest written recipes for making the oldest type of whiskey, Irish, is Plat’s Delight for Ladies (1611) which involved adding 15 grams/liter of botanicals such as aniseed and liquorice to distilled spirit (initially also grape-based, and later grain-based), and letting it sit for three or four days. However whiskey continued to change, first being intentionally aged in former sherry barrels for flavour starting in the 1800s, followed soon after by eliminating botanicals altogether. In a way, barrels took over the role of botanicals for whiskey; genever, though, never changed. 
</p>

<p>All genever was 100% maltwine genever until the late 1800s, by which time Dutch distillers had adopted the column still (patented in 1830) on a wide scale, and the maltwine began to be blended with neutral spirits, much as single-malt whisky in Scotland began to be blended with column-still distillates from the mid-1800s on. 
</p>

<h2>Downfall</h2>

<p>Domestic consumption of genever was booming, and so were exports; the Udolphus Wolfe brand boasted of having sold 45 million bottles around the world by 1893, and in 1892 the town of Schiedam (population then: 24,000) boasted 392 operating distilleries, making it the premier distilling location in the world. 
</p>
<p>However, A quartet of occurrences brought the genever industry almost to extinction, starting at the beginnings of the 1900s.</p> 
<p>The Martini brand launched an “Extra-Dry” vermouth in America in 1900 which quickly became very popular. Dry vermouth doesn’t mix well with malty spirits like genever or whiskey, and the popularity of this dry vermouth led to a decline in sales for genever, which had been riding high as an essential cocktail ingredient. </p> 

<p>WWI (1914-1918) then devastated the home countries of genever; almost all distilleries closed, had their stills appropriated to make armaments, or had to switch to making industrial alcohol for explosives. Plus, as a result of the war, a generation of genever drinkers were wiped out. 
Then, the lucrative export market of the USA closed when Prohibition (1920-1933) was declared. Contrary to popular belief, most people who drank during Prohibition weren’t drinking alcohol smuggled in from abroad, but instead alcohol distilled illegally in the US, made with an eye to speed and the cheapness of distillation instead of flavour or quality. By the end of Prohibition, US tastes had changed to favour more neutral flavours and cocktails which concealed, instead of celebrating, their base spirit, another blow to flavourful spirits like genever.
Finally WWII (1939-1945) again ravaged Holland, Belgium, France and Germany among others, stopping genever production and wiping out another generation. </p>

<h2>Survival</h2>
<p>After WWII, the genever industry was devastated and starting in the 1950s, the big distillers began gambling on a new style of genever with drastically less maltwine, which was termed “jonge jenever” (literally “young genever” but meaning new-style genever”). This led to the existing, high-maltwine genever style being termed “oude jenever” (“literally “old genever’ but meaning “old-style genever”). There were mentions in print in Holland of “jonge jenever” (and therefore also of “oude jenever”) as far back as the mid-1800s, but starting in the 1950s several larger distillers really began pushing the idea of genever with as little as 1% maltwine content, the remaining 99% being grain- or even molasses-based neutral alcohol. This turned out to a wildly successful idea; jonge jenever is essentially vodka, the world’s best-selling spirit, and because in the 1950s there was no significant amount of vodka being sold in Holland, jonge jenever pre-empted vodka in Holland and achieved similar success. Today, over 95% of all the genever sold annually in Holland is jonge jenever. Ruthless price competition in the 1970s & 1980s led to almost all the Dutch distillers stopping with in-house distilling, outsourcing production (often to Belgium), and merely bottling their genever in Holland, all to save a few cents on the production cost of a bottle of jonge jenever. </p>
<p>Corenwyn/korenwijn was created as a kind of premium genever style in the 1970s. Although technically not a genever - as there is no requirement for it to contain juniper—Corenwyn/korenwijn is made identically, must contain at least 51% maltwine, and some of the largest brands are aged in oak barrels for a couple of years. A Corenwyn/korenwijn that does contain juniper may add the word “genever” or “jenever” to its label. Corenwyn/korenwijn is heavily promoted in Holland as a pairing for Dutch raw herring, with both the herring and Corenwyn/korenwijn served chilled. </p>
<p>In 1986, the Herman Jansen company distillery in Schiedam—De Tweelingh—distilled the first 100% maltwine genever with the Seal of Schiedam in thirty years. This was followed by the Genever Museum’s 100% maltwine genever with the Seal in 1998, and then by Old Duff Genever 100% Maltwine with the Seal of Schiedam (distilled at De Tweelingh) in 2017. </p>
