<h1>The History of Genever</h1>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="img/genever/dernaturenbloeme.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Passage in Der Naturen Bloeme, 1269, about distilling juniper as medicine</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Almost as soon as distilling knowledge travelled from the Middle East to Europe as a result of the Muslim invasions of Spain (711 AD) and southern Italy (827 AD), juniper berries began to be preserved in distilled alcohol, which meant the juniper kept its medicinal qualities. Juniper berries, native to Europe, were a wonder medicine, aiding digestion, constipation, and all kinds of gastrointestinal upset, among many other uses. The distilled alcohol used to preserve it was based on local grapes in Spain and Italy, but as distilling knowledge expanded to colder countries like Ireland and Holland, local grains were used to distill instead. 
</p>
<p>The first printed mention of distilling in Dutch was in 1269 and included a reference to juniper, where it was referred to as a medicine. By 1497, “korenbrandewijn” (meaning “grain wine”, and referring to grain distillate with juniper), was so widely recreationally drunk in Holland that it began to be taxed. Initially genever was mostly grape-based, but by  1588 genever in Holland was grain-based more often than not. The quality of the grain distillate was the main attraction, and juniper - plus any other botanical - was very much the supporting actor, imbuing only faint hints of additional flavour. Genever used distilling craft and botanicals for flavour, not barrels, and if it was to be stored or transported, barrels were picked for their neutrality. Incidentally, whisky was at exactly the same stage of its development, at the same time. One of the oldest written recipes for making the oldest type of whiskey, Irish, is Plat’s Delight for Ladies (1611) which involved adding 15 grams/liter of botanicals such as aniseed and liquorice to distilled spirit (initially also grape-based, and later grain-based), and letting it sit for three or four days. However whiskey continued to change, first being intentionally aged in former sherry barrels for flavour starting in the 1800s, followed soon after by eliminating botanicals altogether. In a way, barrels took over the role of botanicals for whiskey; genever, though, never changed. 
</p>

<p>All genever was 100% maltwine genever until the late 1800s, by which time Dutch distillers had adopted the column still (patented in 1830) on a wide scale, and the maltwine began to be blended with neutral spirits, much as single-malt whisky in Scotland began to be blended with column-still distillates from the mid-1800s on. 
</p>


<h2>Rise</h2>

<p>From a strong domestic base in the 1600s, genever companies began expanding and exporting globally, usually to territories which the Dutch East India Company (VOC, founded 1602) and Chartered West India Company (GWIC, founded 1621) traded with, which soon became the entire known world, from the Americas to Africa to Asia and all points in between. Consequently, genever sales really began to explode in the 1700s and 1800s. By the mid-1800s, 450 bottles of Dutch genever were being imported to New York for every 1 bottle of English gin, and large genever companies maintained offices as far afield as Buenos Aires, Melbourne, Lagos, Shanghai, Jakarta, and Mumbai, to name but a few. One genever brand, founded in 1818, exhibited at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago and boasted they had sold 45 million bottles by that date. A lot of the sales by that time were due to the large role genever played in the first Golden Age of cocktails, which began in mid-1800s America. As well as being a very common base for punch, genever was one of only four usual options for a cocktail (i.e., what we would now call an Old Fashioned), the others being brandy, whisky and rum or arrack. By 1892, the small genever town of Schiedam, near Rotterdam was the busiest distilling location in the world, boasting 392(!) distilleries as well as all the concomitant bottle producers, yeast factories and shipping companies.</p>

<p>Genever was so popular it became part of general culture; bestselling author Irving Washington’s 1819 short-story character Rip van Winkle fell asleep for a hundred years after drinking genever with some mysterious characters in upstate New York; in west Africa, genever became part of the Libation ceremony, used to toast spirits and ancestors on important occasions. Every recipe in the world’s first cocktail book (Jerry Thomas’ 1862 Bar-Tender’s Guide) mentioning “gin” as an ingredient is referring to genever (“Holland gin”), not English gin; genever was the standard “gin” until the 1900s. In 1887, celebrated author Lafcadio Hearn wrote of several genever cocktails in “Two Years In The French West Indies”, and around sixty years later the world-famous Ernest Hemingway created a genever cocktail (Death in the Gulfstream) while living and writing in Cuba. </p>


<h2>Downfall</h2>

<p>Domestic consumption of genever was booming, and so were exports; the Udolphus Wolfe brand boasted of having sold 45 million bottles around the world by 1893, and in 1892 the town of Schiedam (population then: 24,000) boasted 392 operating distilleries, making it the premier distilling location in the world. 
</p>
<p>However, A quartet of occurrences brought the genever industry almost to extinction, starting at the beginnings of the 1900s.</p> 
<p>The Martini brand launched an “Extra-Dry” vermouth in America in 1900 which quickly became very popular. Dry vermouth doesn’t mix well with malty spirits like genever or whiskey, and the popularity of this dry vermouth led to a decline in sales for genever, which had been riding high as an essential cocktail ingredient. </p>

<p>WWI (1914-1918) then devastated the home countries of genever; almost all distilleries closed, had their stills appropriated to make armaments, or had to switch to making industrial alcohol for explosives. Plus, as a result of the war, a generation of genever drinkers were wiped out. 
Then, the lucrative export market of the USA closed when Prohibition (1920-1933) was declared. Contrary to popular belief, most people who drank during Prohibition weren’t drinking alcohol smuggled in from abroad, but instead alcohol distilled illegally in the US, made with an eye to speed and the cheapness of distillation instead of flavour or quality. By the end of Prohibition, US tastes had changed to favour more neutral flavours and cocktails which concealed, instead of celebrating, their base spirit, another blow to flavourful spirits like genever.
Finally WWII (1939-1945) again ravaged Holland, Belgium, France and Germany among others, stopping genever production and wiping out another generation. </p>

<h2>Survival</h2>
<p>After WWII, the genever industry was devastated and starting in the 1950s, the big distillers began gambling on a new style of genever with drastically less maltwine, which was termed “jonge jenever” (literally “young genever” but meaning new-style genever”). This led to the existing, high-maltwine genever style being termed “oude jenever” (“literally “old genever’ but meaning “old-style genever”). There were mentions in print in Holland of “jonge jenever” (and therefore also of “oude jenever”) as far back as the mid-1800s, but starting in the 1950s several larger distillers really began pushing the idea of genever with as little as 1% maltwine content, the remaining 99% being grain- or even molasses-based neutral alcohol. This turned out to a wildly successful idea; jonge jenever is essentially vodka, the world’s best-selling spirit, and because in the 1950s there was no significant amount of vodka being sold in Holland, jonge jenever pre-empted vodka in Holland and achieved similar success. Today, over 95% of all the genever sold annually in Holland is jonge jenever. Ruthless price competition in the 1970s & 1980s led to almost all the Dutch distillers stopping with in-house distilling, outsourcing production (often to Belgium), and merely bottling their genever in Holland, all to save a few cents on the production cost of a bottle of jonge jenever. </p>

<p>Corenwyn/korenwijn was created as a kind of premium genever style in the 1970s. Although technically not a genever - as there is no requirement for it to contain juniper—Corenwyn/korenwijn is made identically, must contain at least 51% maltwine, and some of the largest brands are aged in oak barrels for a couple of years. A Corenwyn/korenwijn that does contain juniper may add the word “genever” or “jenever” to its label. Corenwyn/korenwijn is heavily promoted in Holland as a pairing for Dutch raw herring, with both the herring and Corenwyn/korenwijn served chilled. </p>
<p>In 1986, the Herman Jansen company distillery in Schiedam—De Tweelingh—distilled the first 100% maltwine genever with the Seal of Schiedam in thirty years. This was followed by the Genever Museum’s 100% maltwine genever with the Seal in 1998, and then by Old Duff Genever 100% Maltwine with the Seal of Schiedam (distilled at De Tweelingh) in 2017. </p>

<h2>Resurgence</h2>

<p>By the early 2000s, real genever—oude, korenwijn, 100% Maltwine—was all but impossible to find outside its home countries of Holland and Belgium. The companies which owned the largest brands neglected exports and concentrated instead on easier and more lucrative spirits such as vodka and liqueurs. However, since around 1995 a second Golden Age of cocktails had begun, first in London and then New York, then spreading hyperfast around the world on Internet messageboards. Under the tutelage of expert mixologists like Dale de Groff and Dick Bradsell, a new generation of bartenders were learning to make classic cocktails properly; classic recipes, adult flavour profiles, served in small glasses, using freshly-squeezed juices and cocktail bitters—and the correct spirits. As bartenders dived into those old cocktail books, genever kept coming up, again and again. Influential American spirits historian David Wondrich mentioned genever frequently on those messageboards and in his cocktail columns for Esquire magazine, bemoaning its unavailability, culminating in the 2007 publication of his book “Imbibe!”, a biography of the world’s first cocktail book author, legendary bartender Jerry “The Professor” Thomas. In it, Wondrich revealed that all the recipes mentioning “gin” in Thomas’ groundbreaking 1862 book referred to “Holland gin”, a/k/a genever, which led to a stampede among bartenders to get their hands on genever. Dutch brands began to export again, and genever cocktails began to crop up on cocktail menus once more. Starting around 2010, the gin category began to really boom, first in Belgium and then in Holland, leading to many start-up craft gin distilleries being established. After some time, many of these distilleries, competing in the hugely competitive gin market, began to consider expanding and producing genever, which is after all Holland’s distilling history. This has led to many start-up genever brands, both jonge and oude. Old Duff Genever was founded in 2017, the first new 100% maltwine genever with the Seal of Schiedam in almost twenty years and only the third in existence. Most recently, the cover of The Oxford Companion to Spirits And Cocktails (2021) has only one liquor bottle – a Dutch genever bottle – and one cocktail (a genever cocktail, the Holland Razor Blade) – on its cover. Genever is back!</p>
