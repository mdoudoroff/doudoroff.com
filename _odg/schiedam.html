    <h1>Our home: Schiedam</h1>


<p>Today Schiedam is a beautiful suburb of 78,000 people situated about four miles west of Rotterdam, Holland’s second-largest city. But at the peak of the genever industry in the late 1800s, Schiedam housed as many as 392(!) distilleries, plus all the glass factories, packaging, yeast producers, warehousing and shipping businesses needed to supply what at the time was the world’s busiest distilling town, producing and sending genever to every corner of the globe. 
</p>

<p>The reason Schiedam became “the distilling city” of the Netherlands was largely because of… pigs. Historically, many distillers kept herds of pigs because pigs and other animals can be cheaply and efficiently fattened by feeding them “draff”-the nutrient-rich leftover grains from fermentation. Keeping pigs was a way for distillers to hedge their bets; if demand for genever declined, or laws were enforced forbidding the use of grain for anything except bread production (which happened), distillers could fall back on the pigs as a way to make money. Even in the Middle Ages, the city of Rotterdam didn’t want herds of pigs being kept inside the city limits, so distillers moved out to Schiedam, founded on the banks of the river Schie and with easy sea access to the enormous harbour of Rotterdam. Starting around the 1700s, the genever industry in Schiedam really took off, building on domestic demand for genever as well as the century-long existence of the Dutch East India Company (VOC, founded in 1602) and West Indies Company (GWIC, founded 1621). These state-sponsored trading companies established Dutch colonies everywhere from New York and Taiwan to South Africa and the Caribbean - almost always, it must be said, at a terrible human cost to the indigenous peoples of those countries. Sailors on Company ships received daily rations of genever, and both Dutch settlers and natives drank a lot of genever. Whilst being a competitor, the Companies also traded with their counterparts when they could, selling genever to English, French and German colonies as well as their own. VOC & GWIC ships returning to Holland were laden with exotic herbs and spices such as nutmeg, mace, cloves and cinnamon. Initially worth more per pound than gold, as the price of these spices declined they began to find their way into genever and other distillates as botanicals.</p>

<p>The only serious competition for Schiedam was Weesp, a small town fourteen miles south-east of Amsterdam. Several distillers moved out there from Amsterdam in the early 1600s for the same reasons distillers left Rotterdam, with the additional draw that Weesp was famous for its water quality and was already a flourishing beer-brewing town. Weesp never housed more than 22 distilleries however, and they had all closed or moved by the end of the 1700s. </p>

<p>A common nickname for Schiedam was and is Black Nazareth, supposedly for the soot and grime from the distilleries and factories which coated every wall in that teeming industrial city. An explanation for the nickname is also that in the 1700s and 1800s the (much smaller) Belgian genever industry clustered around the towns of Ghent and Nazareth in Belgium which are around one hundred miles southwest of Schiedam. Whenever Belgian distillers had to go to Schiedam to do business or ask advice from their larger Dutch counterparts , they referred to Schiedam as the “Black Nazareth” to distinguish it from “their” Belgian town of Nazareth. </p>

<p>Originally Schiedam had thirty or so windmills to mill grain for the distilleries; today only seven remain, and are the tallest remaining windmills in the world. The former Melchers genever distillery on the Lange Haven waterside has been renovated into the National Genever Museum, with exhibits, a liquor store and tasting bar as well as the intact historical distilling equipment used to make their Old Schiedam brand of 100% maltwine genever. From the peak of 392 operating distilleries, now fewer than six remain which actually distill their products from start to finish. Encouragingly, this number includes both heritage distilleries such as Herman Jansen (dating to 1777), distilleries that were dormant for decades and have been rejuvenated, plus start-up craft distillers who do everything in-house. Since 2014, Schiedam maltwine distillation has been added to the UNESCO inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Netherlands, an important recognition of the importance of Schiedam genever to Holland’s culture. </p>

<p>Every year, the Genever Museum hosts the Genever Festival, featuring tastings, seminars, distilling demonstrations and special Festival bottlings of genever. </p>
